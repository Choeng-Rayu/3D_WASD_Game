## SLIDE 2: Game Concept & Learning Objectives
**Title:** What is This Game?

**Content (Bullet Points):**
- **Concept:** A simple exploration game where players move through an environment and interact with objects
- **Core Mechanics:**
  - WASD Movement (walk forward/back/left/right)
  - Mouse Look (rotate camera to look around)
  - Interaction System (press E to interact with objects)
  
- **Learning Objectives:**
  - Player movement using CharacterController
  - Camera control with mouse input
  - Raycast-based interaction detection
  - Object-oriented programming with interfaces
  - UI management (TextMeshPro)
  - Inventory system

**Speaker Notes:**
"The game is simple but teaches important concepts. Players walk around using WASD, look around with the mouse, and press E when they see interactive objects. This covers movement, input handling, and game logic."

## SLIDE 3: Game Architecture & Scripts
**Title:** How the Game Works - Architecture

**Content (Diagram-style text):**

├─────────────────────────────────────────┤

│ • PickupObject - Collects items         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│    INVENTORY SYSTEM                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • InventoryManager - Tracks items       │
│ • UI Display - Shows collected items    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Scripts Overview:**
1. **PlayerController.cs** - Handles WASD input and movement
2. **MouseLook.cs** - Handles mouse look and camera rotation
3. **InteractionSystem.cs** - Detects objects with raycast, manages prompts
4. **ClueObject.cs** - Displays information when interacted
5. **PickupObject.cs** - Adds items to inventory
6. **InventoryManager.cs** - Manages and displays inventory
7. **IInteractable.cs** - Interface for interactive objects
8. **InteractableObject.cs** - Base class for interactive objects

**Speaker Notes:**
"The game uses a modular architecture. The player system handles movement. The interaction system detects what the player is looking at. Objects respond based on their type - clues show information, items get collected. Everything is organized through interfaces and inheritance, which is good programming practice."

## SLIDE 4: Game Features & Gameplay
**Title:** Features & How to Play

**Controls:**
| Key/Input | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **W** | Move Forward |
| **A** | Move Left |
| **S** | Move Backward |
| **D** | Move Right |
| **Mouse** | Look Around |
| **E** (when prompt shows) | Interact with Object |
| **ESC** | Lock/Unlock Mouse |

**Game Features:**
- ✅ **3D Environment** - Plane ground, multiple interactive objects
- ✅ **Player Movement** - Smooth WASD controls with gravity
- ✅ **Camera System** - Free mouse look, clamped vertical rotation
- ✅ **Interaction Prompt** - "Press E to interact" appears when looking at objects
- ✅ **Clue System** - Examine objects to discover clues
- ✅ **Pickup System** - Collect items that appear in inventory
- ✅ **Inventory UI** - Display collected items in real-time

**Scene Objects:**
- Desk (clue object) - "Desk Note: Found a suspicious note on the desk..."
- Painting (clue object) - "Hidden Safe: There's a safe hidden behind the painting!"
- KeyItem (pickup object) - Collectable item that adds to inventory

**Speaker Notes:**
"The gameplay is straightforward. Players explore the scene, look at objects to see interaction prompts, and can either examine objects for clues or collect items. The inventory tracks everything collected. It's simple but demonstrates all core game mechanics."

## SLIDE 5: Code Quality & Technical Implementation
**Title:** Code Quality & Programming Concepts

**Programming Principles Used:**

1. **Object-Oriented Design**
   - Classes for each system (PlayerController, InteractionSystem, etc.)
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Interfaces & Inheritance**
   - IInteractable interface ensures all interactive objects follow a contract
   - ClueObject and PickupObject inherit from InteractableObject
   - Allows different behavior from same base class (polymorphism)

3. **Clean Code Practices**
   - Meaningful variable names (moveSpeed, interactionRange, etc.)
   - Comments explaining key logic
   - Public fields for easy configuration in Inspector
   - Error checking (null validation)

4. **Design Patterns**
   - **Singleton Pattern** - InventoryManager is globally accessible
   - **Observer Pattern** - Interactive objects respond to Interact() calls
   - **Strategy Pattern** - Different object types behave differently

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - Efficient raycast with limited range
   - Only updates UI when inventory changes
   - Single raycast per frame (not wasteful)

**Code Snippet Example (PlayerController):**
```csharp
void HandleInput()
{
    float h = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
    float v = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
    
    moveDirection = transform.forward * v + transform.right * h;
    if (moveDirection.sqrMagnitude > 1f) moveDirection.Normalize();
}
```

**Evaluation Criteria Met:**
- ✅ **Design** - Clean modular architecture
- ✅ **Movement & Controls** - Smooth WASD + mouse controls
- ✅ **Object Interaction** - Raycast-based detection, multiple interaction types
- ✅ **Code Quality** - Well-organized, reusable components, good naming conventions
- ✅ **Bonus** - Could add: multiple scenes, level progression, more complex puzzles

**Speaker Notes:**
"The code demonstrates professional programming practices. I used interfaces to create a flexible system where different objects can behave differently. The code is organized into separate scripts that each handle one responsibility. This makes it easy to modify, debug, and extend. The architecture could easily support more complex games by adding new script types."

## KEY TALKING POINTS TO MEMORIZE

1. "This is a learning project that teaches fundamental game development concepts"
2. "The game uses WASD for movement and E to interact with objects"
3. "I used object-oriented programming with interfaces to create a flexible system"
4. "The interaction system uses raycasts to detect what the player is looking at"
5. "Everything is organized into separate scripts for clean, maintainable code"
6. "Different object types (clues, pickups) behave differently through inheritance"

---

## POSSIBLE QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: Why did you use interfaces?**
A: Interfaces allow different objects (ClueObject, PickupObject) to behave differently while following the same rules. It makes the code more flexible and easier to extend.

**Q: How does the interaction system detect objects?**
A: It shoots an invisible ray from the camera. When the ray hits an object with an IInteractable script, it shows the prompt. When E is pressed, it calls the Interact() function.

**Q: How did you handle inventory?**
A: I created an InventoryManager singleton that tracks items in a Dictionary. When an item is picked up, it's added to the dictionary and the UI updates automatically.

**Q: Could you add more features?**
A: Yes! I could easily add: multiple scenes/levels, a quest system, more interactive puzzles, sound effects, animations, or save/load functionality.

**Q: What was the hardest part?**
A: Understanding how raycast works and making sure the interaction system detected objects correctly. Once I got that working, everything else came together.
